### Setup

This howto is designed to help using the Arduino code


### Fast I2C Communication

(from here: http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,16793.0.html)

the atmega-hardware can do 400 KHz, but you have to tweak the Wire-library in file hardware/libraries/Wire/utility/twi.h.
Near the top of the file you see :
Code:
<blockquote><p>
#ifndef TWI_FREQ
#define TWI_FREQ 100000L
#endif
</p></blockquote>
If you change that to
Code:
<blockquote><p>
#ifndef TWI_FREQ
#define TWI_FREQ 400000L
#endif
</p></blockquote>
The IÂ²C bus should run at 400kHz
But you also have to the delete the files
hardware/libraries/Wire/Wire.o
hardware/libraries/Wire/utility/twi.o

This will force the compiler to recompile these files.
